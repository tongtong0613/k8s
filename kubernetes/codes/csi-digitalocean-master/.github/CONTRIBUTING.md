Thanks for trying to improve the csi-digitalocean experience. 

1. If you add a new feature then please don't forget to update the
   CHANGELOG.md:
   https://github.com/digitalocean/csi-digitalocean/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md.
   You should add a separate commit with the line change, **after** opening the
   Pull Request (to get the correct PR number).
2. If it's a breaking change or exceeds 100 lines of code then please open an
   issue first and describe the changes you want to make.
